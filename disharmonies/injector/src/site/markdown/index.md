# SiliconCode Software Injector

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/MSUSEL/msusel-software-injector.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/MSUSEL/msusel-software-injector)

The _SiliconCode software injector_ is designed to provide the basis for conducting
empirical studies concerning software design disharmonies. This is done by providing
simple transforms which allow the injection of simple artifacts into existing software
source files. The combination of these simple transforms can allow the creation of much
more complex artifacts such as **code smells**, **anti-patterns**, **design patterns**,
**code issues**, and **design pattern grime**.

Developing these complex transformations, or _injection strategies_, allows for the
capability to evaluate their effect on measurable qualities such as _maintainability_,
_security_, _reliability_, and even _technical debt_.
