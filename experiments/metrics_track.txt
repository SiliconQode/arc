## QMOOD

[X] Design Size in Classes -> NOT
[X] Number of Hierarchies -> #Hierarchies
[X] Average Number of Ancestors -> averaged count of the number of ancestors for all classes in the system.
[X] Data Access Metric -> Ratio of the number of private/protect attributes to the total number of attributes declared in the class
[X] Direct Class Coupling -> count of classes directly coupled to a class including relations due to attribute declarations and message passing parameters in methods
[X] Cohesion Among Methods of Class -> 1-LCOM4
[X] Measure of Aggregation -> #Data Decls whose type is a user defined type
[X] Measure of Functional Abstraction -> Ratio of Number of Inherited Methods to Num Method Avail
[X] Number of Polymorphic Methods -> NOP = #Methods that exhibit polymorphic behavior

## Other Findings

### From object.qm
Handled by FB: Mutable object declared as constant -- Check if there are constant fields that refer to arrays. Despite the constant declaration, the referenced array could be modified.
Handled by FB: Non constant and static -- This rule warns if a non-constant public static field is found. In a multi-threaded environment access to those fields must be synchronized.
Handled by PMD: Statically unused -- A method parameter is unused, if its value is never accessed.
Handled by PMD: Statically unused -- Checks whether a private method is unused.
Handled by PMD: Statically unused -- Checks whether a private field is unused.


### Root - Manual
Proportion of misspelled and cryptic identifiers
Proportion of statically unused non-private subroutines
Proportion of missing or incomplete comments
Proportion of helpful comments
Proportion of meaningless and misleading identifiers
Proportion of identifiers in default language
Proportion of identifiers that are synonyms
Proportion of outdated comments

### Root
Encoding Check -- Invalid Character
Language Count -- Number of different natural languages in comments
